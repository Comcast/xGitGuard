## Overview

- **Detecting Publicly Exposed Secrets on GitHub at Scale**
  - xGitGuard is an AI-based system designed and developed by the Comcast Cybersecurity Research and Development team that detects secrets (e.g., API tokens, usernames, passwords, etc.) exposed on GitHub. xGitGuard uses advanced Natural Language Processing to detect secrets at scale and with appropriate velocity in GitHub repositories.
- What are Secrets?
  - **Credentials**
    - Usernames & passwords, server credentials, account credentials, etc.
  - **Keys/Tokens**
    - Service API tokens (AWS, Azure, etc), encryption keys, etc.

## Features

### Credential Detection Workflow

- [Enterprise Credential Secrets Detection](#enterprise-credential-secrets-detection) - Run Secret detection on the given `GitHub Enterprise` account
- [Public Credential Secrets Detection](#public-credential-secrets-detection) - Run Secret detection on the `GitHub Public` account

  ![](assets/keys_Token_Detection_workflow.png)

### Keys&Token Detection Workflow

- [Enterprise Keys and Tokens Secrets Detection](#enterprise-keys-and-tokens-secrets-detection) - Run Secret detection on the given `GitHub Enterprise` account
- [Public Keys and Tokens Secrets Detection](#public-keys-and-tokens-secrets-detection) - Run Secret detection on the `GitHub Public` account

  ![](assets/keys_Token_Detection_workflow.png)

## Install

### Environment Setup

- Install [Python >= v3.6]
- Clone/Download the repository from GitHub
- Traverse into the cloned `xGitGuard` folder

  ```
  cd xGitGuard
  ```

- Install Python Dependency Packages

  ```
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Check for Outdated Packages

  ```
  pip list --outdated
  ```
  
## Search Patterns

- There are two ways to define configurations in xGitGuard

  - Config Files
  - Command Line Inputs

- For **`Enterprise`** Github Detection **`(Secondary Keyword + Extension)`** under config directory
  - Secondary Keyword: secondary_keys.csv file or User Feed - list of Keys & Tokens
  - Secondary Keyword: secondary_creds.csv file or User Feed - list of Credentials
  - Extension: extensions.csv file or User Feed - List of file Extensions
- For **`Public`** Github Detection **`(Primary Keyword + Secondary Keyword + Extension)`** under config directory

  - Primary Keyword: primary_keywords.csv file or User Feed - list of primary Keys
  - Secondary Keyword: secondary_keys.csv file or User Feed - list of Keys & Toekns
  - Secondary Keyword: secondary_creds.csv file or User Feed - list of Credentials
  - Extension: extensions.csv file or User Feed - List of file Extensions

### Enterprise Github Secrets Detection

#### API Configuration Setup

- Setup the system Environment variable below for accessing GitHub
  - **`GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`** - Enterprise GitHub API Token with full scopes of repository and user.
    - Refer to the GitHub documentation [How To Get GitHub API Token] for help
- Update the following configs with `your Enterprise Name` in config file **`xgg_configs.yaml`** in config Data folder **`xgitguard\config\*`**
  - enterprise_api_url: `https://github.<<`**`Enterprise_Name`**`>>.com/api/v3/search/code`
  - enterprise_pre_url: `https://github.<<`**`Enterprise_Name`**`>>.com/api/v3/repos/`
  - url_validator: `https://github.<<`**`Enterprise_Name`**`>>.com/api/v3/search/code`
  - enterprise_commits_url: `https://github.<<`**`Enterprise_Name`**`>>.com/api/v3/repos/{user_name}/{repo_name}/commits?path={file_path}`

#### Running Enterprise Secret Detection


- Traverse into the `github-enterprise` script folder

  ```
  cd github-enterprise
  ```

#### Enterprise Credential Secrets Detection

##### Detections Without Additional ML Filter

By default, the Credential Secrets Detection script runs for given Secondary Keywords and extensions without ML Filter.

```
# Run with Default configs
python enterprise_cred_detections.py
```

##### Detection With ML Filter

xGitGuard also has an additional ML filter where users can collect their organization/targeted data and train their model. Having this ML filter helps to reduce the false positives from the detection.

##### Pre-Requisite To Use the ML Filter

User Needs to follow the below process to collect data and train the model to use ML filter.

- Follow [ML Model Training](#ml-model-training)

> **NOTE** :
>
> - To use ML Filter, ML training is mandatory. This includes data collection, feature engineering & model persisting.
> - This process is going to be based on user requirements. It can be one time or if the user needs to improve the data, then needs to be done periodically.

##### Command to Run Enterprise Credential Scanner with ML

```
# Run for given Secondary Keyword and extension with ML model,
python enterprise_cred_detections.py -m Yes
```

#### ML Model Training

#### Enterprise ML Model Training Procedure

To use ML Feature, ML training is mandatory. It includes data collection, feature engineering & model persisting.

> **Note:** Labelling the collected secret is an important process to improve the ML prediction.

  ```
  cd ml_training
  ```

```
  cd ml_data_collector\github-enterprise-ml-data-collector
```

- Credentials

  1. Run for given Secondary Keywords and extensions
     ```
     python enterprise_cred_data_collector.py
     ```
  2. To run with other parameters, please use help.
     ```

##### Review & Label the Collected Data

1. By default all the data collected will be labeled as 1 under column "Label" in collected training data indicating the collected secret as a valid one.
2. **`User needs to review each row in the collected data and update the label value.`**
   **`i.e: if the user thinks collected data is not a secret, then change the value to 0 for that particular row.`**
3. By doing this, ML will have quality data for the model to reduce false positives.

##### Feature Engineering

Traverse into the "ml_training" folder

- Credentials

##### Review & Label the Collected Data:

1. By default, all the data collected will be labeled as 1 under column "Label" in collected training data indicating the collected secret as a valid one.
2. **`User needs to review each row in the collected data and update the label value.`**
   **`i.e: if the user thinks collected data is not a secret, then change the value to 0 for that particular row.`**

  ```
  python model.py key -s public
  ```

- For help on command line arguments, run
  ```
  python model.py  -h
  ```
  > **Note:**
  >
  > - If persisted model **xgitguard\output\public\_\*xgg\*.pickle** is not present in the output folder, then use feature engineered data to create a model and persist it.
  > - By default, when feature engineered data collected in Public mode not available, then model creation will be using enterprise-based engineered data.

### Additional Important Notes

- Users can update confidence_values.csv based on secondary_keys, secondary_creds, extensions value and give scoring from level 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest) to denote associated keyword suspiciousness.
- If users need to add any custom/new secondary creds/keys or extensions to the config files, then the same has to be added in the confidence_values.csv file with respective score level.
- Stop Words provided in config files are very limited and generic.Users need to update stop_words.csv with keywords considered has false postives to filter it out from the detections.
- Users can add additional extensions to extensions.csv to search types of files other than the default list.
- Users can enhance secondary_creds.csv/secondary_keys.csv by adding new patterns to do searches other than the default list.
- Users need to add primary keywords for public search in primary_keywords.csv after removing the sample content.
- In case of GitHub API calls resulting in 403 due to API rate-limit, increase the throttle timeout (github.throttle_time: 10) in the config ("config/xgg_configs.yaml)".
